# First Learning in Java

This repo is a recording of my first learning in Java. Aside from a couple of versions of the Hello World program in search of a decent learning platform, the exercises here are taken from the [Code Academy Learn Java](https://www.codecademy.com/enrolled/courses/learn-java) course.
