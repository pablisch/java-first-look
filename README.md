# First Learning in Java

This repo is a recording of my first learning in Java. Aside from a couple of versions of the Hello World program in search of a decent learning platform, the exercises here are taken from the [Code Academy Learn Java](https://www.codecademy.com/enrolled/courses/learn-java) course.

## Files

### HideAndSeek.java
The difference between println() and print().

### Ca1.java
Basically Hello World.

### Ca2Comment.java
Single line and multi-line comments.

### Ca3LanguageFacts.java
Use of whitespace for readability and semi-colons to end statements.

### Ca4Compiling.java
