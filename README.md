# First Learning in Java

This repo is a recording of my first learning in Java. Aside from a couple of versions of the Hello World program in search of a decent learning platform, the exercises here are taken from the [Code Academy Learn Java](https://www.codecademy.com/enrolled/courses/learn-java) course.

## Running the exercise files in this repo

Clone the repo to your local machine
From the root directory of the repo, run the following command to compile the exercise file you want to run:
```
javac <file_path/exercise_file_name>.java
```
Then run the following command to run the compiled file:
```
java <file_path/exercise_file_name>
```

Example:
To run the Store1.java file in the Ca5_Methods directory, run the following commands:
```
javac Ca5_Methods/Store1.java
java Ca5_Methods/Store1
```

## Files

**Note:** 'Ca' stands for Code Academy. The files were initially all in the root directory of the repo, but I have since moved them into directories based on the Code Academy course structure.
File names up to and including Ca4 follow the name of the exercise in the Code Academy course. From Ca5 onwards, the file names are based on the class name in the exercise.
